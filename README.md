# Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem  

This repository contains the data and code used in the manuscripts:  
- [arXiv:2403.16766](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16766)  
- [arXiv:2403.16787](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16787)  

The code aims to solve the **Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem** with sequencing flexibility and position-based learning effects.  
It includes implementations of **Constraint Programming**, **Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)** models, and **heuristic/metaheuristic** methods.

## ðŸ“Œ Prerequisites  

- **IBM CPLEX 22.1**  

---

## ðŸ“„ Instance Format  

Each instance consists of:  
- The **first line**: Number of operations, number of arcs, and number of machines.  
- The **next lines**: Arcs defined by their origin and destination.  
- The **remaining lines**: Machines that can process each operation and their respective processing times.  

### ðŸ”¹ Example:  

```plaintext
5 3 2  # 5 operations, 3 arcs, and 2 machines

0 1    # arc 0, origin and destination
0 2    # arc 1, origin and destination
3 4    # arc 2, origin and destination

2 0 1 1 2  # 2 machines can process operation 0, machine 0 with processing time 1, machine 1 with processing time 2
1 1 2      # 1 machine can process operation 1, machine 1 with processing time 2
2 0 1 1 2  # 2 machines can process operation 2, machine 0 with processing time 1, machine 1 with processing time 2
1 0 1      # 1 machine can process operation 3, machine 0 with processing time 1
2 0 1 1 2  # 2 machines can process operation 4, machine 0 with processing time 1, machine 1 with processing time 2

```
### ðŸ”¹ Precedence arcs representation

The precedence arcs can be visualized as follows:

## ðŸš€ How to Run  

1. **Edit the `Makefile`** to update the path to IBM CPLEX and the path to the source files.  
2. **Open a terminal** in the folder where the `Makefile` is located.  
3. **Run the following commands:**  

```bash
chmod u+x makefile
./make
./FJS instance $instance output $output time-limit $time-limit learning-rate $learning-rate seed $seed
```
after seed parameter the other parameters are method-dependent.

Here we document each method parameter:
  - MILP Model
  - CP Model
  - Tayebi Genetic Algorithm
  - Constructive heuristic
  - Local Search
  - ILS
  - Tabu Search
  - Simulated Annealing
  - GRASP
